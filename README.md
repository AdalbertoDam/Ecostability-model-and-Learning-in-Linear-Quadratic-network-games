## Statistical Learning projects

This repository contains the assignments projects performed during the Master Course of 'Physics of Complex Systems' at Politecnico di Torino during the academic year 2022/2023.
The assignments focus on the practical implementation of renowned statistical learning techniques for supervised learning and neural networks. 
For the former, the techniques covered included the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Gaussian Discriminative Analysis, and Kalman Filter.
Transitioning to neural networks, I embarked on projects involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for digit recognition and applied transfer learning to image classification tasks.
All methods are implemented from scratch using basic libraries such as numpy, and applied to well-known datasets.
